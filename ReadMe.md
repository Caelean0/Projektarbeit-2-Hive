# Hive – 2nd Semester Project

This project, "Hive", was created by Team WenigerSalz, consisting of 2nd semester Game Development students at SRH Heidelberg.
The assignment was to create a 2D top-down pixel art game with a custom mini-engine using C++ and the Raylib library.
The Executable for the Game can be downloaded here:

The team consists of the following members:
- Designers: Nino Tkalec, Leon Tschurtschenthaler
- Artists: Nauras Sharaf, Paula Seemann
- Programmers: Joséphine Cholle, Keanu Grespan
- Music: Raphael Wendorff (external)

## Development Process

The entire production of this game prototype took place over the span of one semester (6 months).
Within this time, all of the following had to be built from the ground up:

- Game Design
  - Game Concept
  - Game Mechanics Development
  - Level Design
  - Game Balancing
- Game Art Assets
  - Character Sprites and Animations
  - Interactable Object Sprites and Animations
  - Background Tileset
  - Menus
- Game Engine Programming
  - Base Engine Setup: updating, static and animated sprite rendering, event and input handling, sound handling, etc.
  - Core Gameplay Functionality Implementation
  - Interaction interface between the level builder (Tiled) and the engine using the Tileson library
  - Toolchain setup and maintenance (level builder Tiled, engine, GitHub repository)
    
- Project Management Toolchain (This repository does not contain a GitHub Wiki; all project management and documentation were done using Atlassian software: Jira & Confluence)
- Social Media Content

Considering that the entire project was developed within just six months and with very limited prior experience in game engine funtionality, the team is proud of what has been accomplished.
While there are aspects that, in retrospect, could (and probably should) be approached differently, the final product is fully functional and currently free of known bugs. 
Well done, team!
